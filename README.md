Simple interactive pong game built using OpenGL, GLUT and SOIL library. Project was created as part of Computer Graphics course which I attended on Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb.


## Tools 

* [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) - Open Graphics Library API!
* [freeglut](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/) - Freeglut v3
* [SOIL](https://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) - Simple OpenGL Image Loader

## Build

Source is built using `compile.sh` script which requires preinstalled libraries.
